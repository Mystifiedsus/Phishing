# Phishing Awareness

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers attempt to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and financial details by posing as a trustworthy entity. The goal of phishing is to trick individuals into willingly disclosing their confidential information or performing actions that may compromise security.

## Key Characteristics of Phishing Attacks:

### 1. Deceptive Communication:
Phishing attacks often involve deceptive communication, such as emails, messages, or websites designed to appear as if they are from a legitimate source.

### 2. Impersonation:
Attackers may impersonate well-known organizations, financial institutions, or trusted individuals to gain the trust of the target.

### 3. Email Phishing:
The most common form of phishing involves sending fraudulent emails that mimic legitimate correspondence. These emails often contain links to fake websites or malicious attachments.

### 4. Spear Phishing:
In spear phishing, attackers target specific individuals or organizations. The messages are highly customized and may include personal information to increase their credibility.

### 5. Smishing and Vishing:
Phishing attacks may also occur through SMS (smishing) or voice calls (vishing), where attackers use text messages or phone calls to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.

### 6. Fake Websites:
Phishers often create fake websites that mimic the appearance of legitimate sites. Victims may unknowingly enter their credentials or personal information on these fraudulent pages.

### 7. Credential Harvesting:
The primary objective of many phishing attacks is to harvest login credentials. Once obtained, attackers may use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to accounts.

### 8. Financial Fraud:
Some phishing attacks are designed to trick individuals into providing banking details or credit card information, leading to financial fraud.

### 9. Malware Delivery:
Phishing emails may contain malicious attachments or links that, when clicked, install malware on the victim's device. This malware can be used for various malicious purposes.

### 10. Social Engineering:
Phishing relies heavily on social engineering techniques to manipulate individuals into taking specific actions without questioning the legitimacy of the request.

## Prevention Strategies:

- **User Awareness:** Educate users about the risks and characteristics of phishing attacks.
- **Security Measures:** Implement email filtering, multi-factor authentication, and other security measures.
- **Vigilance:** Stay vigilant when interacting with online communication. Be cautious about clicking links and providing personal information.
